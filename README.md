# Assembly Language Programs

## LOOP QUESTION

### Description

This assembly language program replicates the behavior of the provided C-like program. It initializes a variable `x` to 14 and repeatedly subtracts one from `x` and adds the value of `x` to a `sum` until `x` is greater than or equal to 8.

### Usage

1. Assemble the program using an appropriate assembler for your target architecture.
2. Run the assembled program.
3. The program will calculate and display the final value of `sum` after the loop terminates.

## ARRAY QUESTION

### Description

This assembly language program replicates the behavior of the provided C-like program. It initializes an array `A` with values `[1, 11, 18, 19, 10]` and creates an array `B`. It then iterates through the elements of `A`, adds 1 to each element, and stores the result in the corresponding index of array `B`.

### Usage

1. Assemble the program using an appropriate assembler for your target architecture.
2. Run the assembled program.
3. The program will modify array `B` to contain the updated values `[2, 12, 19, 20, 11]`.
